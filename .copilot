# Git Commit Best Practices

1. **Write Clear and Concise Commit Messages**
    - Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").
    - Keep the subject line to 50 characters or less.
    - Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
    - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.

Example of a good commit message:
Add user authentication

- Implement login and registration functionality
- Add password encryption using bcrypt
- Create user session management
- Update tests to cover new authentication features
